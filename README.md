# Building Mesherizer

This is a project that aims to allow users to create mesh geometries by drawing on top of combined vector and raster layers. This will allow users to determine the geometry of the structure (from the vector boundary) while drawing lines determined by the changing heights in the raster layer.

To test out, clone this repository then install dependencies and start the local server:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
